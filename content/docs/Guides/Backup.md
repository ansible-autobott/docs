        jail_dir: "/home"
        # remove: false

      - group_name: goback
        allow_password: false
        jail_dir: "/var/goback"
        # remove: false

  users:
    - username: goback
      enabled: true
      delete_home: false
      name: "goback"
      primary_group: "goback"
      groups: []
      shell: /bin/false # optional
