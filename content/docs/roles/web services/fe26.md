## Proxy Configuration

Once enabled you can point a reverse proxy to: `127.0.0.1:7070` (if you did not change the port)

Sample vhost configuration.
```yaml
- name: myserver
  enabled: true
  servers:
    - enabled: true
      domains:
        - "https://fe26 .my-domain.com"
      type: "proxy"
      proxy_url: "http://127.0.0.1:7070"

```
